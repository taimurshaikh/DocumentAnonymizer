In a recent study, a topology-evolving method called Cellular Encoding (CE; Gruau et al., 1996) was compared to
a fixed-network method called Enforced Subpopulations
(ESP) on the double pole balancing task without velocity
inputs (Gomez and Miikkulainen 1999). Since ESP had no
a priori knowledge of the correct number of hidden nodes
for solving the task, each time it failed, it was restarted
with a new random number of hidden nodes. However,
even then, ESP was five times faster than CE. In other
words, evolving structure did not improve performance in
this study.
